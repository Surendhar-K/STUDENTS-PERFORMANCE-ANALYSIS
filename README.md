==> STUDENTS PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS <==

Project Title: Student Performance Analysis - Classification-Based Approach

📜 Overview:

I am excited to share my latest project, "Student Performance Analysis," which leverages machine learning to predict and analyze students' academic outcomes. This project involved extensive data processing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of various classification models to gain insights into factors affecting student performance.

🗝️ Key Highlights:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned and scaled to ensure optimal model performance, focusing on key features such as age, study time, absences, and parental education level.
 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA was conducted to identify patterns and correlations within the data. Visualizations like distribution plots and correlation matrices helped uncover relationships between variables.

Machine Learning Models: I applied several classification algorithms, including:
 Random Forest Classifier: Achieved the highest accuracy of 91%, highlighting its effectiveness in handling complex datasets.
 Logistic Regression: Provided a solid baseline with a 75% accuracy rate.
 Support Vector Machine (SVM): Matched logistic regression with a 75% accuracy, offering robust classification capabilities.
 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Demonstrated reliable predictions with 75% accuracy.

 Decision Tree Classifier: Also achieved 75% accuracy, emphasizing interpretability and ease of use.

Evaluation Metrics: Models were assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure comprehensive performance evaluation.

🫴Insights:

Feature Importance: Variables such as weekly study time and parental education significantly impacted student performance, providing actionable insights for educational interventions.

Model Comparisons: The Random Forest model outperformed other classifiers, indicating its suitability for complex educational datasets.

👋Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in education by identifying key performance drivers and offering predictive insights. These findings can aid educators and policymakers in developing targeted strategies to improve student outcomes.

I would like to thank Hellotech Softwares for guidance.
